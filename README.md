# There will be 2 options, select the first one and create a new private key..
# After the command, it will give you a link (most likely pink), paste it into the search bar on the near wallet page you created.
#Then enter your password and confirm.
# Wait for a few minutes 
# Then go back to your server and press enter.

# Congrats ! You're a node runner
